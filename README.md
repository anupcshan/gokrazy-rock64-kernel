# gokrazy Rock64 kernel repository

This repository holds a pre-built Linux kernel image for RK3328-based
Rock64 from Pine64, used by the [gokrazy](https://github.com/gokrazy/gokrazy) project.

The files in this repository are picked up automatically by
`gokr-packer`, so you donâ€™t need to interact with this repository
unless you want to update the kernel to a custom version.

## Updating the kernel

First, install docker.

Then, build a new kernel - take about 5 minutes.
```
go run ./cmd/gokr-rebuild-kernel/kernel.go
```
